This repository is used for **issue tracking**, **content delivery**, **feedback** and more. This repository does not contain source code of Nebula itself, only some libraries.

Interested in purchasing Nebula? Purchasing is possible on both [BuiltByBit](https://bbyb.it/nebula) and [sourceXchange](https://sourcexchange.net/products/nebula). We only sell on those marketplaces, refrain from obtaining a copy from other distributors as they are illegally distributing our work without sharing a single dime which hurts development.
