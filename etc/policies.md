When buying Nebula you buy "**1 (one) license**". This license should only be used on servers that **THE LICENSE OWNER** owns, virtually (a virtual private server that **THE LICENSE OWNER** rents) or physically (a server that is owned and managed by **THE LICENSE OWNER**).

Redistributing or illegally downloading Nebula and/or parts of it's source code without written consent by us ("prpl.wtf") is not only strictly forbidden, but also significantly hurts development.

"prpl.wtf" reserves the right to update this policy at any moment, without prior notice.\
"prpl.wtf" reserves the right to revoke your license and access to Nebula if:
- The license owner opens a chargeback/case/dispute through PayPal or other means.
- The license owner receives a full refund of a copy of Nebula.
- "prpl.wtf" has reasonable suspicion that the license owner is breaking the EULA.

"sourcexchange.net" and "builtbybit.com" reserve the right to revoke your license without any notice at any moment.

Additionally to previously-mentioned terms, the following apply to all sales of Nebula:
- You may not resell this product.
- You may not relicense this product.
- You may not make this product accessible to anyone who does not require access in order to work on the projects which this product is required for, and you will be held responsible if the product is shared outside of your project.

Depending on the situation, we may provide you with a (in some cases partial) refund even if it would technically be against the rules detailed below. You can find contact information over on [`www.prpl.wtf`](https://prpl.wtf).

- If you are a parent/guardian and wish to refund a purchase made by your child (up to 15 years of age) **on your behalf** and contact us within 30 days of the purchase being made, you will receive a full refund. We may ask for additional information to prevent abuse.
- If you purchased this resource by mistake or have changed your mind, contact us within 7 days and have not downloaded a copy of Nebula, you can receive a full refund.
- If you cannot run Blueprint on your panel, have problems regarding other modifications or unrelated errors in general, we will not provide a refund.
- We do not provide support or refunds through disputes, cases and chargebacks, but defend our case instead.
